      "The principles of responsible and good corporate governance determine the conduct of the management and supervisory bodies of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG. Carl Zeiss Meditec has combined its Declaration on Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d HGB with its corporate governance reporting, thus conforming to principle 22 of the German Corporate Governance Code, DCGK 2020. Pursuant to Section 317 (2) Sentence 6 HGB, the auditor checked that the disclosures pursuant to Section 289f (2) and (5) and Section 315d HGB had been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Declaration on Corporate Governance was last updated in December 2020.\n",

      "The Management Board and Supervisory Board of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG hereby declare, pursuant to Section 161 (1) Sentence 1 AktG, that since issuing its last Declaration of Conformity on 6 December 2019, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG has conformed to the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated 7 February 2017, with the following exceptions, hereinafter referred to as DCGK 2017, and will conform to all recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated 16 December 2019, as published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on 20 March 2020, with the following exceptions, hereinafter referred to as DCGK 2020:\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to Section 5.4.1 (2) and (3) DCGK 2017 and Section C.1 DCGK 2020, the Supervisory Board has not defined any specific targets for its composition. The Supervisory Board has also not specified any statutory competency profile for the board as a whole and this is therefore also not published in the Declaration on Corporate Governance. Contrary to Section 5.4.1 (2) DCGK 2017, the Supervisory Board has not set any control limit for length of service. The Supervisory Board believes that the composition of the board should be geared, first and foremost, to the interests of the Company, and should guarantee efficient support and monitoring of the Management Board. Accordingly, when appointing the Supervisory Board of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, the priority shall therefore be to ensure that the members have the necessary capabilities, skills and specialist qualifications to properly fulfill their duties, and that they are independent. The Supervisory Board believes that the necessary competencies of the board as a whole have been adequately considered. The Supervisory Board also sees no need for a change with respect to a control limit for the length of service of its members, since the Supervisory Board's rules of procedure already specify an age limit, the members of the Supervisory Board are mandated for a limited period, and, in view of the Company-specific situation, the expertise of longstanding members of the Supervisory Board should not be categorically dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to Section D.7 DCGK 2020, the members of the Management Board attend the meetings of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the Supervisory Board’s rules of procedure, unless the Chairman of the Supervisory Board specifies otherwise. The Management Board provides the Supervisory Board with regular, up-to-the-minute, comprehensive information, particularly about corporate strategy, planning, the development of business, the risk situation, risk management, compliance, the focus of innovation and about any deviations of business development from original planning, as well as important business transactions of the Company and major subsidiaries of the Group. The Supervisory Board uses its meetings for regular, detailed exchange with the Management Board. For certain issues, the Supervisory Board convenes alone during the plenary session.\n",
      "\n",
      "The General Committee of the Supervisory Board of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG revised the current remuneration system for the Management Board in the fourth calendar quarter of 2020, which is to be applied for all new contracts concluded with members of the Management Board and is to be presented at the Annual General Meeting 2021. The resolution by the full board is planned for no later than April 2021. According to the current status of discussions, the new Management Board remuneration system deviates from the following recommendations of DCGK 2020: \n",
      "\n",
      "Section G.4 DCGK 2020 states that in order to assess the customary practice within the Company, the Supervisory Board should consider the relationship of the remuneration of the Management Board to the remuneration of senior management and the workforce as a whole and also consider how this has developed over time. Contrary to this, the new remuneration system does not provide for any comparison of the remuneration of the Management Board with the remuneration of senior management and the workforce as a whole. As the remuneration of the Management Board is capped, its appropriateness with regard to the remuneration structure is not called into question. A vertical comparison is therefore not necessary in the Supervisory Board’s opinion. A comparison with the remuneration of senior management and the workforce as a whole is also not sufficiently meaningful in the Supervisory Board’s view. Due to the international nature of the Company, its various locations worldwide and the associated regional differences, salary structures are very different, which would not provide any meaningful transparency if compared with the remuneration of the Management Board.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Section G.6 DCGK 2020, the variable remuneration, which is determined based on the achievement of long-term objectives, should exceed the proportion of remuneration arising from short-term objectives. Contrary to this, under Carl Zeiss Meditec AG’s new remuneration system, the inflow of funds from the Short Term Incentive Program (STI) shall generally be higher than that from the Long Term Incentive Program (LTI). However, the maximum amount achievable under the LTI may exceed the STI amount. The LTI and the selection of KPIs create and thus ensure a long-term incentive effect. The current system has proved successful in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Section G.7 DCGK 2020, the Supervisory Board is to define the performance criteria for all variable remuneration components for each member of the Management Board for the upcoming fiscal year, which – in addition to operative objectives – should be geared especially to strategic objectives. The Supervisory Board should also determine to what extent individual objectives of the individual members of the Management Board or objectives for all members of the Management Board collectively are crucial. These requirements are generally to be implemented by the Company in the new remuneration system. Contrary to Section G.7 DCGK 2020, there will be a one-off deviation from this in fiscal year 2020/21, however, because the Supervisory Board has decided as an exception, due to the extremely high level of planning uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, to not set objectives until the start of fiscal year 2020/21.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuant to Section G.8 DCGK 2020, a subsequent amendment of the targets or comparative parameters should be excluded. The new remuneration system is to explicitly exclude the amendment of the personal variable remuneration during the year (STI component); however, contrary to Section G.8 DCGK 2020, it is to be possible to amend STI financial targets and LTI parameters during the year due to special economic circumstances – the Supervisory Board considers this option to be appropriate in exceptional cases, as extraordinary economic circumstances on the capital market shall always be made transparent in good time and taken into consideration in the Company’s forecast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to Section G.10 DCGK 2020, under the new remuneration system, variable remuneration amounts granted shall not be predominantly invested in shares of the Company or granted on a share basis, taking the respective tax burden into account. In addition, there is to be no uniform regulation that stipulates that the Management Board member may not access the long-term variable amounts granted until after four years. The Supervisory Board does not consider a share-based remuneration to be an improvement for a long-term incentive compared with the measurement of the sustainable value-added created in the Management Board objectives based on EVA and FCF. The long-term incentive is sustainable through the LTI and the selection of KPIs; the current system has proven successful in the past. The long-term variable remuneration is currently fixed for 3 years This period is considered sufficient in terms of longevity and sustainability and is in line with the Company’s medium-term planning horizon in budget planning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Section G.12 DCGK 2020 recommends, in the event of the termination of a Management Board contract, that the outstanding variable remuneration components attributable to the time remaining until the end of the contract be paid out in accordance with the originally agreed objectives and comparative parameters and in accordance with the due dates or holding periods specified in the contract. Contrary to Section G.12 DCGK 2020 and in the interest of simplifying the processing of early contract terminations, the inclusion of an average variable remuneration component should, in principle, be compensated with the severance payment under the planned remuneration system.  \n",
      "Contrary to Section G.13, the new remuneration system does not provide for the severance payment to offset the compensation in the event of a post-contractual prohibition of competition. \n",

It should be noted that although Dr. Markus Guthoff has been a member of Carl Zeiss Meditec’s Supervisory Board for longer than 12 years, his independence is assumed, since the other indicators under Section C.7 DCGK 2020 are fulfilled.

Their wealth of experience gained from their membership of the Supervisory Board to date is used in the best interests of the shareholders for the best possible management of the Company.

In summary, the Supervisory Board considers in particular the following aspects:\n",
      "The Supervisory Board regularly assesses the effectiveness of its committees and of the Supervisory Board as a whole. During the past fiscal year the Supervisory Board conducted a self-assessment, to evaluate the efficiency of its activities. This took the form of a questionnaire, in which the members of the Supervisory Board gave their appraisal of the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees and suggested possibilities for improvement. \n",

      "The Supervisory Board supports the objectives of the Law on the Equal Participation of Men and Women in Leadership Positions, as well as the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code, and has therefore decided upon a gender quota of at least 30% for the Supervisory Board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, three members of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's nine-strong Supervisory Board are female, one on the employee representative side and two on the shareholder representative side. The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is therefore 33%, thus fulfilling both the Company’s target and legal requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Supervisory Board has also stipulated specific target quotas for women on the Management Board. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Supervisory Board has set itself the objective to also increase the participation of women on the Management Board in the medium term but does not see any possibility to realize this change in the short term. The Supervisory Board therefore continues to formally adhere to the existing quota of zero percent. \n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve equal participation of women and men in leadership positions, the Management Board considers it essential, in addition to stipulating target quotas for upper-level and top-level management, to increase the proportion of women in upstream management levels, and is accordingly focusing its recruitment efforts and internal support measures on this. \n",
      "\n",
      "On 18 January 2018, the Management Board adopted the resolution to create transparency about the current proportion of men and women at the top management levels and the determination of target quotas for Carl Zeiss Meditec AG. The defined target quotas as of 30 June 2022 for the equal participation of women and men in leadership positions are 22% in the first management level and 27% in the second management level. In order to achieve these target quotas, an action plan with recommendations for action has been drafted, which is to be implemented by 30 June 2022 to sustainably achieve the target quotas and thus close the gap with the previous fiscal year, during which the target quotas were not achieved in full. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Management Board firmly believes that being able to find a better balance between work and family life is one of the key factors for a more appropriate participation of women in leadership positions. The management is therefore supporting a large number of measures to achieve this objective. Furthermore, the Management Board believes that the stipulation of target quotas can be reconciled with the primacy of quality in filling specific leadership positions, if the target quota is seen to be a business requirement and an expression of purposeful human resources policy, rather than detailed planning for specific leadership positions. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a publicly listed company, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG adheres to the guidelines for diversity in terms of the composition of its Management Board and Supervisory Board, which are derived from the German Stock Corporation Act and the German Corporate Governance Code. \n",

      "However, this is not yet subject to an explicitly formulated diversity concept in accordance with Section 289f (2) No. 6 HGB, which contains precise information on age, gender, educational or professional background. The Supervisory Board believes that the composition of both bodies should focus primarily on the Company’s interests and should give priority to the skills, knowledge and professional qualifications and experience of its members necessary for both bodies to properly fulfill their duties. This concept has so far been successful in the Supervisory Board’s opinion. \n",

      "The Annual General Meeting was held on 6 August 2020 in the form of a virtual meeting at the business premises of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG in Jena. The calculated presence was around 88.82% of the total voting share capital. The voting results from the most recent Annual General Meeting can be inspected on the Company's website at www.zeiss.de/meditec-ag in the \"Investor Relations\" section under \"Financial calendar”, “Annual General Meeting 2020”.\n",

Telephone conversations, conferences and regular visits to the Company with or by investors, during which the Company explains its philosophy, the development of its business and its strategy, serve as additional channels of communication for the Company.\n",

The annual consolidated financial statements and the interim reports of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group have been prepared by the Management Board since 2005 in accordance with the principles of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as they are to be applied in the European Union. The annual financial statements are audited and approved by the Supervisory Board. The annual financial statements prepared in accordance with German commercial law are thus adopted.\n",

EY was first appointed in fiscal year 2012/13.\n",

      "The Supervisory Board agreed with the auditor that the Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee shall be immediately informed of any disqualification or bias issues that may arise during the audit, if these cannot be remedied. The requirements concerning the internal rotation of auditors (Section 319a (1) Sentence 1 No. 4 HGB) were complied with.\n",
